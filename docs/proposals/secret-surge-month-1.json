    "description": "## Secret Surge Proposal - Unleashing the Power of Private DeFi\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to give a significant push to the Secret DeFi ecosystem. This initiative involves a 6-month incentive program totaling roughly $4M in rewards ($1M of which in SCRT), which is set to commence on April 18, 2023, with an initial \"surge\" period during the first three months to encourage the swift launch of projects.\n\nFor dApps to be eligible, they will need to present an incentivization plan which contributes 3x the L1 rewards in dapp tokens ($1 SCRT for every $3 in dapp tokens). Additionally, L1 Rewards will be given as an LSD (each protocol can choose which one), and ideally - in a form of a deferred LSD.\n\nSCRT Labs has volunteered to contribute half of the total SCRT cost - $500K. The remainder would be split between the community pool ($250K) and the Terra Builders Fund ($250K), to reduce the impact on the pool itself. Any remaining Terra Builders Fund would be burned as originally anticipated.\n\nThe community's pool portion would be allocated on monthly spend proposals to a wallet SCRT Labs controls. The first month is based on the current projection of SCRT's price (`2/3*1/3*$250,000/$0.67` = **82919 SCRT**). From the second month and on the request would adjust to reflect SCRT's price changes.\n\nFull discussion and details of the proposal can be found here: [https://forum.scrt.network/t/secret-surge-proposal-pushing-secret-defi-further-than-ever/6898](https://forum.scrt.network/t/secret-surge-proposal-pushing-secret-defi-further-than-ever/6898)\n",
