# Secret Network v1.12 Upgrade

This proposal recommends that the chain undergo a software upgrade to version v1.12 of the Secret Network codebase on secret-4 block 11,136,666. The estimated time for the upgrade is **Tuesday, October 17, 2023, at ~2pm UTC**.

Since block times can vary significantly, we advise monitoring the chain for a more precise upgrade time. ETA monitor: [mintscan.io](https://dev.mintscan.io/secret/blocks/11136666) or [ping.pub](https://ping.pub/secret/block/11136666).

- Add hardcoded admins according to proposals [269](https://dev.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/269) (Shillables) & [270](https://dev.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/270) (Sienna).
- Fix PFM to stop dropping packets of IBC contracts.
  - This has always been a bug in PFM. It was introduced in v1.9 and was missed because of a bug in our CI system.
